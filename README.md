# Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance Portfolio

This repository contains selected files from two projects completed as part of the course, showcasing skills in software testing, automation, and quality assurance. These files include:

- **Project One:** Contact Service Files
  - `Contact.java`
  - `ContactService.java`
  - `ContactTest.java`
  - `ContactServiceTest.java`
  
- **Project Two:** Summary and Reflections Report

Together, these artifacts demonstrate the ability to create unit tests, analyze software testing approaches, and apply appropriate testing strategies to meet specific requirements.

## Reflections on Software Development and Testing

### How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure functionality and security, I write comprehensive unit tests, like those included in `ContactTest.java` and `ContactServiceTest.java`. These tests help identify potential errors and edge cases early. Additionally, I follow best practices such as validating inputs, handling exceptions gracefully, and using secure coding principles to minimize vulnerabilities.

### How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Interpreting user needs involves analyzing requirements and translating them into features and constraints. For example, in the `Contact` class, I implemented constraints like maximum lengths for names and phone numbers to ensure data integrity and align with user expectations. By understanding these requirements, I designed the program to meet both functional and non-functional needs effectively.

### How do I approach designing software?
My approach to software design is iterative and modular. I start by breaking down the problem into manageable components, as seen in the separation of concerns between `Contact` and `ContactService`. I use object-oriented principles to ensure scalability and maintainability, allowing each part of the program to evolve independently while ensuring cohesion in the overall design.
